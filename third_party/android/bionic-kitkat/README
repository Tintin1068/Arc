TODO(crbug.com/432441): Always compile our code with 64bit long double and
remove this directory.

This directory contains Bionic sources from KitKat.
We partially use modified version of them, and these modified files track
files in this directory.

They are from AOSP Bionic (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic),
and the revision is 8e39d2f9f403639195e430f81a47ad3940bd6975
