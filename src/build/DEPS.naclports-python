# naclports publishes continuous build artifacts to googlestorage, with
# a browsable front-end at gsdview.appspot.com/naclports/builds/.  Any recent
# python distribution should be fine for this purpose, we do not compile
# anything else against it so it just needs to function hermetically with our
# apk_to_crx.py script.
